# weather
I just completed a weather app that provides real-time weather updates with an interactive and engaging UI. 
This project allowed me to work extensively with the Android SDK, integrating APIs to fetch weather data and displaying it dynamically. 
The app also features background videos and animations that change based on the current weather conditions, 
making it both informative and visually appealing. This was a great opportunity to further enhance my skills in Android development and Java.
